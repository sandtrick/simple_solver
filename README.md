## Dynamic Equation Builder and Solver (DEBS)

### Goal

The goal is to create a system that enables the speedy
creation of solvable equations (variables contain dimensions)
that solve for any variable without the need for the
programmer to write each equation arrangement per independent
variable.

### Requirements

1. Minimize steps needed to add a new equation
2. Solves equation without programming arrangements
3. Functions with non-uniform input dimensions
4. Outputs solved-variable with requested dimensions
5. Accounts for SI and imperial unit systems

Optional:
* Prints solution in unicode
