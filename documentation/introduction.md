# The Vision

Mathematics is a tool used by designers on a consistent
basis. Engineers use equations to do anything from
calculate heat flow to measure the forces on a skyscraper
on a windy day. There comes a time for many engineering
students the when algebra involved in solving these equations
is nothing more than tedious. What *can* be difficult is knowing
which set of equations to use to solve a problem.

By having a system that allows engineers to have access to
a database of relevant equations it frees them up
to spend more time learning and studying the proper
use of the mathematics. The Dynamic Equation Builder
and Solver (DEBS) aims produce the framework for
a system that will provide:

* a massive database of equations with proper-use documentation
* user ability to build and store personal equations
* equations that solve themselves given non-uniform dimensions
* the possibility of wiki-like equation pages (for the less-esoteric equations)
